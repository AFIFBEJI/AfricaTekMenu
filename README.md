# 🍽️ Git AfricaTEK Menu Together!

Welcome to the **Git AfricaTEK Menu Together!** workshop — a playful and powerful way to learn GitHub collaboration while celebrating cultural diversity through food! 🌍👩‍🍳

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Workshop Concept

In this workshop, each team (formed by participants from different countries) will collaboratively create a **three-course menu**:
- 🥗 Starter  
- 🍛 Main Course  
- 🍰 Dessert  

Each team:
- Creates their own menu
- Writes their recipes regarding the shared Template (Use IA tools to create a menu.html file respecting the Templae)
- Uses GitHub to push changes, open pull requests, and collaborate

## 🌍 Peer Learning through Food

Along the way, teams will:
- Present their dishes to others
- Explain the origin, ingredients, and preparation of their meals
- Learn about different cultures
- Practice teamwork and Git collaboration

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each `menu.html` file should include:
- 🇨🇵 Name of the dish
- 📜 Description and origin
- 🥒 Ingredients
- 🖼️ Optional image

## 💡 Git Workflow You’ll Use
-1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account

-2. Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-your-menu-together.git
cd git-your-menu-together

-4. Add your team’s files (menu.html)
git add .

-5. Commit your changes
git commit -m "Add team-name starter"

-6. Push your branch to your fork
git push origin team-name

🛠️ Then:

- Go to your fork on GitHub

- Open a Pull Request to the original repository

- Collaborate via comments, suggestions, and reviews

- Once approved, your menu will be merged into the global one 🎉

##Bon appétit & happy collaborating! 🎉
