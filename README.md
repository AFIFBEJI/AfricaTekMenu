# 🍽️ Git Your Menu Together!

Welcome to the **Git Your Menu Together!** workshop — a playful and powerful way to learn GitHub collaboration while celebrating cultural diversity through food! 🌍👩‍🍳

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Workshop Concept

In this workshop, each team (formed by participants from different countries) will collaboratively create a **three-course menu**:
- 🥗 Starter  
- 🍛 Main Course  
- 🍰 Dessert  

Each team:
- Creates their own folder
- Writes their recipes in Markdown format
- Uses Git and GitHub to push changes, open pull requests, and collaborate just like in a software project

## 🌍 Peer Learning through Food

Along the way, teams will:
- Present their dishes to others
- Explain the origin, ingredients, and preparation of their meals
- Learn about different cultures
- Practice teamwork and Git collaboration

## 📁 Repository Structure


Each `.md` file should include:
- 🇨🇵 Name of the dish
- 📜 Description and origin
- 🥒 Ingredients
- 🧑‍🍳 Preparation steps
- 🖼️ Optional image

## 💡 Git Workflow You’ll Use

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/git-your-menu-together.git
cd git-your-menu-together

# Create and switch to your team branch
git checkout -b team-name

# Add your files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Add team-name starter"

# Push your branch
git push origin team-name


Bon appétit & happy collaborating! 🎉
